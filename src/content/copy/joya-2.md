## Joya is an ongoing exploration into the relationship between human industry and natural processes. Using discarded materials such as aluminum cans and locally sourced earth and concrete, I create intricate sculptures and installations that both celebrate and interrogate our impact on the world around us. Through my practice, I hope to inspire viewers to reflect upon their own role in shaping the environment and consider ways in which they can contribute to positive change. Come discover the beauty and complexity of Joya and join me on this journey towards sustainability and resilience.
