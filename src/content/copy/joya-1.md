## This was a unique project that focused on both the environment and conceptual artistry. Using locally sourced materials such as soil and concrete, I created sculptures that question the relationship between natural and artificial forms. These pieces were then carefully placed within the rugged terrain shaped by the forces of nature itself - in this case, the impact of heavy rainfall on the region.
