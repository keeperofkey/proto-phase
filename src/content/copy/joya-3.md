## Exploring the intersection between humanity and nature through the lens of sustainability and conservation. By casting discarded beer cans in local soil mixed with concrete, I aimed to draw attention to the impact our consumer culture has on the environment. The installation itself was created in a region ravaged by severe storms and flooding, which serves as a reminder of how climate change affects us all. Through this piece, I hope to inspire conversation around these important issues.
